John likes to play with string and he always tries to do something new with it. This time he found a very typical way to sort a string. What he did is that he took a string composed of both lowercase and uppercase letters and sorted it in such a manner such that the uppercase and lowercase letter comes in an alternate manner but in sorted way.  He needs your help to complete this job as fast as possible.
